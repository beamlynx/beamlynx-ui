## Keeping This File Up to Date

When working in this codebase, if you discover a new pattern, convention, architectural decision, or corrected assumption that would be useful for future interactions, **add it to this file**. This includes:

- New or clarified conventions (naming, structure, error handling, etc.)
- Architectural patterns or decisions that are not obvious from the code alone
- Deprecated patterns and their replacements
- Module boundaries and ownership (e.g. which module owns which concept)
- Corrections to previously held assumptions
